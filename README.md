## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **VinÃ­cius Luz AssunÃ§Ã£o**, and I am a Graphic Designer with 10 years of experience working at the **SuperintendÃªncia de Estudos EconÃ´micos e Sociais da Bahia (SEI)**. At SEI, I contribute to the development of editorial materials, visual identities, illustrations, and digital interfaces, supporting the institution in producing studies and analyses that foster economic and social development in the state of Bahia.

Currently, I am expanding my expertise to include **Front-end Development**, focusing on enhancing my skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, as well as tools and frameworks aimed at creating user interfaces (UI/UX). I believe in combining my design background with development to create more effective and engaging digital experiences. I'm passionate about continuous learning and always open to challenges that broaden my knowledge in both design and technology.

Here on GitHub, youâ€™ll find my projects where I integrate my design and development skills. Feel free to explore and collaborate!
